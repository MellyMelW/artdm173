                    <div class="div1"><img src="images/butterfly.png" alt="butterfly"></div>
                    <p>Butterfly comes from a game called Illusion Connect. She is a good healer in the game. I fell in love with her character design. From the flowers to the butterflies but there was one part in her design that was a bit weird. The shackle on her left ankle. I didn’t get to read her story before the game shut down.</p>

                    <div class="div2"><img src="images/milkywaycookie.webp" alt="milkywaycookie"></div>
                    <p>Milky Way Cookie comes from a game called Cookie Run Kingdom. She is a charge type and her position is front. She is the conductor of the Sugarcloud Express. Her character design and voice is super cute and fitting.</p>

                    <div class="div3"><img src="images/klee.webp" alt="klee"></div>
                    <p>Klee comes from a game called Genshin Impact. She is a little girl that is very destructive when adventuring (she likes to create bombs and explode them.). She was the first character I saw that made me want to get Genshin Impact but sadly I couldn’t because I don’t have time to be on the game. Her character design is alright in my opinion.</p>

                    <h2>The Mind's Eye</h2>
                    <div class="div4"><img src="images/mindseye.webp" alt="mindseye"></div>
                    <p>The Mind’s Eye aka Helena Adams comes from a game called Identity V. She is a decoder. This character is blind and when you play as her in the game everything is dark until she hits her cane on the ground to see where the hunter is. I like her because she isn’t an easy character to play and keeping the hunter busy isn’t an easy task with her either. Her character design is a bit boring but some of her skins are nice.</p>

                    <div class="div5"><img src="images/floryn.png" alt="floryn"></div>
                    <p>Floryn comes from a game called Mobile Legends. She is a healer and can heal everyone on the map no matter where she is. When she first came out it was a bit difficult to understand what she does but the more I played her the more I understood. Now she is my favorite healer in the game. Her character design is cute especially because of dew.</p>

                    <h2>Ms. Fortune</h2>
                    <div class="div6"><img src="images/msfortune.webp" alt="msfortune"></div>
                    <p>Ms. Fortune comes from a game called Skullgirls. She got dismembered because her and her gang were trying to steal the life gem (a gem that give you immortality) from another gang. Before she got dismembered she swallowed the life gem. I love her gameplay. The way she can take off her head and use it to attack the enemy is super cool. Her combos are a bit difficult to get though. Her character design is really cool.</p>
