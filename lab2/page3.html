                    <div class="div1"><img src="images/mako.webp" alt="mako"></div>
                    <p>Mako is from the anime Girls und Panzer. She is mostly tired through the day but has a lot of energy at night. She likes to eat sweets and sleep. The reason I like her more than most of the other characters throughout the series is because she reminds me of myself.</p>

                    <h2>Junko Konno</h2>
                    <div class="div2"><img src="images/junko.webp" alt="junko"></div>
                    <p>Junko is from the anime Zombieland Saga. She was a famous idol/singer from the 80s. She died in a plane crash but was resurrected by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi with 6 other girls to save Saga. Her soft spoken voice when she’s off stage and her powerful singing voice on stage is what made me love her character.</p>

                    <h2>Rika Furude</h2>
                    <div class="div3"><img src="images/rika.webp" alt="rika"></div>
                    <p>Rika is from the anime Higurashi. She is the shrine maiden/priestess in Hinamizawa. She has been living through a time loop to save herself and her friends from dying to Miyo Takano. What made me like her as a character is that even though she’s been living in a time loop for about a 100 years she doesn’t give up and still keeps trying.</p>

                    <h2>Homura Akemi</h2>
                    <div class="div4"><img src="images/homura.webp" alt="homura"></div>
                    <p>Homura is from the anime Madoka Magica. She made a wish to save her friend Madoka from dying. She is also living through a time loop but the difference between her and Rika is that it’s a lose lose situation. If she keeps going through time loops Madoka wish gets stronger but if she stops she’ll turn into a witch. What makes me love this character so much is her backstory and how she’s trying to save everyone but can’t because people don’t trust or believe what she is saying about witches and magical girls.</p>

                    <h2>Kanata Konoe</h2>
                    <div class="div5"><img src="images/kanata.webp" alt="kanata"></div>
                    <p>Kanata is from the anime Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club.  She is a caring, soft spoken, relaxed character . She is a solo idol in the anime. She is very sleepy or is asleep through most of her scenes. What makes me like this character is that she takes care of her little sister and the club like it’s her family.</p>

                    <div class="div6"><img src="images/ibuki.webp" alt="ibuki"></div>
                    <p>Ibuki is from Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. She is known as the Ultimate Musician. She is very energetic and upbeat. She has a lot of interesting expressions she makes when she talks. What I love about her is her character design. Even though she’s supposed to be from the light music club she doesn’t dress like it.</p>
